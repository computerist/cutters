# cutters
For people that like 3d printers and playdough. Or who like 3d printers and have kids that like playdough.

The basic idea is that, given a 2 dimensional shape (by specifying a layer within a .dxf file), this will create a playdough / cookie cutter shape that you can export as stl (or whatever) to 3D Print.

Note: If you want to make cookie cutters, you should seriously consider getting some food-safe plastic (and probably an extruder head that you only use for food-safe plastics) since plasticisers are not good for you.

Have fun.
